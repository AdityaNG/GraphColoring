# Graph Coloring
Graph coloring is computationally hard. It is NP-complete to decide if a given graph admits a k-coloring for a given k except for the cases k âˆˆ {0,1,2} . In particular, it is NP-hard to compute the chromatic number. The 3-coloring problem remains NP-complete even on 4-regular planar graphs.[27] However, for every k > 3, a k-coloring of a planar graph exists by the four color theorem, and it is possible to find such a coloring in polynomial time.

# Mapping from Number Of Colours and Index i to Color Combination

When distributing the task across multiple cores, it is necessary to have mapping from `CORE_ID` to `SUBPROBLEM_ID`

```python
# Look at p2i.py
>>> v = 3 # Number of vertices 
>>> for c in range(1, v+1):
>>>     print('colors : ', c)
>>>     for i in range(c**v):
>>>         print(' ', 'index : ', i, '\t->', [c,i] ,'->\t', dec_to_base(i, c).zfill(v))

# Testing Serial vs pThread Implementation

Given an input graph of 8 nodes, the serial version takes 24 seconds and the pThread implementation takes under 2 seconds. A massive 12x speedup (for 8 node graphs).

## Graph Coloring using Welsh Powell algorithm

Welsh Powell algorithm is a greedy technique to solve the graph coloring problem

### Algorithm
```
0. Define X=0
1. Find the degree of each vertex
2. List the vertices in order of descending degrees.
3. Colour the first vertex with color X.
4. Move down the list and color all the vertices not connected to the coloured vertex, with the same color.
5. X=X+1
6. Repeat step 4 on all uncolored vertices with a new color, in descending order of degrees until all the vertices are coloured.
```

## Graph Coloring using Brute Force

Brute force looks at all possible colour combinations that a graph can have. Note that a graph with N verticies will have a maximum of N colors, this will be the upper bound.

### Algorithm
```
0. Set num_colors to N
1. Try all valid coloring combinations with a max N colors
2. If at least one valid combination is found, save num_colors to be the min
3. Decrement num_colors
4. If num_colors>0 goto 0. Else exit
```

#### Sample input:

```
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

#### Sample output:
```
min_colors: 3
```
